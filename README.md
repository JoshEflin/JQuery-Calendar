# JQuery-Calendar
A simple calendar app made using JQuery and Bootstrap
# Description
 This Calendar tells you the current time and accepts user input (presumably activites to be performed at any given hour)
 and stores them in local storage. It color codes the time of day to indicate whether the scheduled time is before during or after the current time.
 When the User presses the reset button, the page is refreshed and the calendar is cleared.
